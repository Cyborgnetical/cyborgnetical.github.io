			<h2>Story</h2>
			I started learning about web development during quarentine because I was bored. 
			I became good at it and made a game but never got that far, once school resumed and I got homework I quit for a while.
			Then one of my teachers said that they needed a website so I took the job, and with a lot of help from my freinds I made a good website.
			Fast foward, a month and now this snowballed into my life now, I get to to what I like and what I am good at, with a good reason.
			One day I would like to become an Aerospace enginner and make my own models, experimenting with designs and watching my creations go.
