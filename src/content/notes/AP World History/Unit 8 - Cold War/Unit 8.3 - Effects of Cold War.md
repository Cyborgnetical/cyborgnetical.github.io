# Splitting of countries
A lot of countries got split into a Communist and Capitalist Side
The USA and USSR could not negotiate to unite them back
Examples:
- Germany:
	- Split due to fears of Germany somehow rising up and becoming a threat again
	- First was split into occupied zones
	- Later merged but couldn't agree to merge them back
		- West Germany
			- Capitalist
			- Democracy
		- East Germany
			- Communist 
			- Authitarian
	- Same was the fate to many countries after WW2
- Vietnam
- Korea
- China (Civil War)
	- Was split between nationalist and communist
# Alliances
- NATO and Warsaw Pact
- ## NATO
	- Created to defended against the USSR
		- Attack on one is attack on all
	- Still here today
	- USSR attempted to apply to NATO and got rejected lol
- ## Warsaw Pact
	- Anti-NATO
	- The cheap Temu knockoff of NATO
	- Created by the USSR and named after Poland capital
	- Comprised of the USSR and eastern Europe under USSR control
# Power of the Atom
## AKA: The nuclear bomb
- Used to end WW2 in Asia and prevent invasion of japan
- After that the USA had a monopoly on nuclear weapons and could threat
- ### The USSR gains nukes
	- Afraid of this nuclear monopoly the USSR develops its own nukes
	- A nuclear arms race is created, whom ever can create the most and devastating nukes
	- Leads into the cold war because both realize that we can eliminate the entire world
