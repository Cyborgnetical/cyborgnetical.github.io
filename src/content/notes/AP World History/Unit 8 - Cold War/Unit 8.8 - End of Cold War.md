The USSR fell, thats all folks

# Failing USSR
- **USSR economy was stagnating** (not growing)
- Attempted to invade Afghanistan
- Drained a lot of resources 
- Remember, no ***growing economy, no more resources.***
# Economic Problems
- Big arms races between USA and USSR
- USA accelerating at rapid speed with multiple programs and defense strategies
- USSR could not sustain this race, lead to economic decline
# Gorbachev Reforms
- New leader Gorbachev (rip 1931 ~ 2022) attempts free policies
- Uses perestroika to reconstruct economy and glasnost to open up to free press
- New democratic movements
- Final nail in coffin with a failed communist coup attempting to out Gorbachev before he could reform USSR
- Collapsed into multiple nations, mainly modern day Russiagh
