# Responses
## Violence and authoritarianism
- Remember what the USSR did to keep itself together?
- Countries such as Uganda, Chile, or Cambodia used military control along with extreme violence to keep power.
## Military Industrial Complex
- So the united states invested a heck ton into defense
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyZoUfNsUl8">After World War II we spent so much in defense we created the largest military industry ever.</a>
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCHH24bGZh4">and thats where lockheed comes in</a>
- Drove nations to increase defense spending drastically
- Now drives many present day conflicts
## Terrorism as political Tools
Why do we have this
