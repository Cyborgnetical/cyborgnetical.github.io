# Creation of new States
This was basically a mess. Now matter if negotiated or conflict, independence lead to the rise of new conflicts in previous colonized regions.

# Examples
- ## India & Pakistan
	- So far under Gandhi the Muslims and Hindu remained somewhat united .
	- There goes Gandhi and he is assassinated
	- Muslims split into the Muslims League seeking a separate Muslim state
	- As a result we got Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh
	- ### Kashmir Conflict
		- Yeah you didn't think this was gonna be so peaceful now would it.
		- After that partition there was a large scale migration based on religious lines
		- Both India and Pakistan claim the province of Kashmir
			- Kashmir was important because resources
			- More Muslim than Hindu
			- Owned by India
		- Both fought for the region, also more migration.
- ## Israel & Palestine
	- So under the Zionist movement there had been mass migration by Jews to the region of Palestine.
	- Arabs also lived there
	- Owned by the British who handed the job of spiting Israel to the UN
	- Created Israel & Palestine, and because Arabs and Jews had conflicting religions the region became a hot spot for turmoil
	- Still in conflict today.
- ## Egypt
	- We all know the policies that was enacted by Gamal Abdul Nasser
		- Socialism
		- Land Reforms
		- Infrastructure development
	- Except when he nationalized the Suez Canal the region went to conflict 
	- Now you have the USA and USSR fighting to secure their interests
# But How
Remember how there were a lot of intellectuals who became the main driving force for independence?
How did they get educated?
No this is not chat-gpted, I just am not doing this at 3am.
## Metropoles
- So a lot of people from colonies migrated to their land of their colonizers
- They studied there and became very educated
	- Why does this sound like my life
- Became influenced by enlightenment ideas
- When they came they lead independence movements.
- ## Migration after decolonization
	- They still continued to do this even after indipendance
	- Seen as a way to gain better opportunities at life
	- Also lead to mix of many nationalities
