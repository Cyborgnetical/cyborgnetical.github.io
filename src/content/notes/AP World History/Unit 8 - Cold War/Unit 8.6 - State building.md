# Creation of new States
This was basically a mess. Now matter if negotiated or conflict, independence lead to the rise of new conflicts in previous colonized regions.

# Examples
- ## India & Pakistan
	- So far under Gandhi the Muslims and Hindu remained somewhat united .
	- There goes Gandhi and he is assassinated
	- Muslims split into the Muslims League seeking a separate Muslim state
	- As a result we got Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh
	- ### Kashmir Conflict
		- Yeah you didn't think this was gonna be so peaceful now would it.
		- After that partition there was a large scale migration based on religious lines
		- Both India and Pakistan claim the province of Kashmir
			- Kashmir was important because resources
			- More Muslim than Hindu
			- Owned by India
		- Both fought for the region, also more migration.
- ## Israel & Palestine
	- So under the Zionist movement there had been mass migration by Jews to the region of Palestine.
	- Arabs also lived there
	- Owned by the British who handed the job of spiting Israel to the UN
	- Created Israel & Palestine, and because Arabs and Jews had conflicting religions the region became a hot spot for turmoil
	- Still in conflict today.
- ## Egypt
	- We all know the policies that was enacted by Gamal Abdul Nasser
		- Socialism
		- Land Reforms
		- Infrastructure development
	- Except when he nationalized the Suez Canal the region went to conflict 
	- Now you have the USA and USSR fighting to secure their interests
# But How
Remember how there were a lot of intellectuals who became the main driving force for independence?
How did they get educated?
No this is not chat-gpted, I just am not doing this at 3am.
## Metropoles
- So a lot of people from colonies migrated to their land of their colonizers
- They studied there and became very educated
	- Why does this sound like my life
- Became influenced by enlightenment ideas
- When they came they lead independence movements.
- ## Migration after decolonization
	- They still continued to do this even after indipendance
	- Seen as a way to gain better opportunities at life
	- Also lead to mix of many nationalities

### Migration to Metropoles

The video notes that decolonization led to significant migration patterns, where people from former colonies, like Indians and Algerians, moved to their former imperial metropoles seeking better economic opportunities. This migration reshaped the demographics and cultural landscapes of those metropoles, highlighting ongoing colonial connections.
