The treaty of Versailles placed heavy economic burden on the Central Powers making them pay back war reparations to the allied nations. Russia is in a civil war, The German Empire is turned into the weimar republic and forced to pay to france, Austria-Hungary collapses into multiple balkan states, the Ottoman Empire collapses and turns into modern day Turkey, the USA and UK basically leave, and Italy is left without what they were promised.
