# Ideologies

## Democracy

- Promises made to improve life after war
- Had to use propaganda to gain some support.
## Communism

- Rapid Industrialization
- Large Scale Mass production for war (moved factories more inland to protect industry)
## Fascism

# Repression of freedom
- In the USA, Japanese people had been sent to camps due to fear of loyalty to Japanese Empire
- Jews discriminated in Europe due to Hitler blaming them for the loss of WW1.
- Anyone not Japanese or allied to Japan, having freedoms removed and sometimes experimented while under Japanese rule.
