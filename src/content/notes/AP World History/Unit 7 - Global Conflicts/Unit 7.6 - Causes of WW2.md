# European Nationalism & Fascism
- Go back to unit 7.5 and 7.4, look at the states that suffered the most
- Those two (Germany and Italy), would eventually go to the extremes due to suffering from the consequences of WW1
- ## Rise of Fascism
	- Originated in Italy
	- Used propaganda and extreme nationalism
	- Focuses on state interest rather than the people
	- Spread due to appealing to nations in ruins and its people
# Imperialism
- Look at previous notes on Japan, explanations there. 
- Italy wanting an empire participated in WW1
	- Expanded a bit in Europe but not all the land was promised
	- Expanded in last unconquered portions (by European powers) of Africa (Ethiopia)
- Germany
	- Germany had fallen under Nazi control.
		- Allies Appeased Germany to prevent war.
		- War Broke out when Germany began to invade 
		- Allies stopped appeasement
		- Wanted living room for "Aryan race" called Lebensraum
- Japan
	- Kept on expanding in Asia
	- Begun brewing culture of extreme devotion
		- No surrender
		- No stepping back
		- Dying in battle
	- Fascism appealed to their government and people
- Victorious Powers
	- Kept their colonial holding
	- Didn't change much and kept on being colonists.
