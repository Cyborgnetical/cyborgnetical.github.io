# Continued Colonial Rule

- Many colonies saw the war a means to gain Independence from their colonial rulers
- Instead colonies just moved Hands
- ## Hopes from the mandate system
	- Suggested by the USA
	- Divided colonies into 3 categories
		- Class C - Small Population, Under developed (Treated as colonies)
		- Class B - Big Population, Under developed (Ruled by victorious powers, not colonies)
		- Class A - Big Population, Properly developed (Suited for Independence
	- ==In theory, supposed to slowly create self governed nations==
	- ==In practice, just led to colonies==

# Tensions in European States

# Summary
Everyone in the loosing side of WW1 was pissed. They resent many of the victorious power leading to WW2. The colonies of victorial powers had also demanded independence, of course they didn't grant it but it started to show cracks in their empire.
