# Decline of the Ottoman Empire

Ottomans Attempted reforms via the Tanzimat Reforms. w/ help of Young Ottomans
- Industry and Democracy
- Worked in Short run


When threaten with war the sultan went back to authoritarian.

New group, Young Turks rose up and overthrew the sultan. Created reforms:

Failing and corrupt government

- Ra Ra, Rasputin. Somehow making it into the royal family and messing with affairs
- Tsar Nicholas II being an incompetent and brutal authoritarian ruler.
- Brewing communist uprising promising peace, bread, prosperity and generally appeasing to common people
- Eventual communist overthrow after fail reforms and great losses from ww1

# Fall of the Qing Dynasty in China
Didn't change at all

- Uses old practices
- Refused to do refroms
- Didn't use industry at all

The Great powers had attempted to gain power in china to offset their trade deficit with them
- first opium war to expand trade rights
- second opium war to get people addicted
All of these wars leading to Qing Dynasty slowly loosing control and people falling to starvation and drugs
- multiple uprisings suppressed by help of imperial powers in order to keep trades
- chaos after multiple rebellions
This only leading the rise of the republic of china which later fell to the people's republic of china. Modern day China & Taiwan
